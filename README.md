## Code Overview

The JavaScript code consists of the following functions:

### `pickcomputerMove()`

This function randomly selects a move for the computer. It generates a random number and assigns a move based on the value of the random number.

### `game(playerMove)`

This function represents a single round of the game. It takes the player's move as input, generates the computer's move, determines the result of the round, updates the score, and displays the result on the screen.

### `updateScore()`

This function updates the score displayed on the screen based on the current values stored in the `localStorage`.

### `score`

This variable stores the current score (number of wins, losses, and ties) in the `localStorage`. If no score is found in the `localStorage`, it initializes the score to zero.
